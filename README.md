## What is Ten Percentery?
TenPercentery is an Open Source, multi-player, persistent browser based game (or [PBBG](http://pbbglab.com/pbbg)).
Create your account, and start building your stable of actor talent. Get them paid, and get paid in return.

## Why create TenPercentery?
I was playing an early access game on Steam with a similar, solo player, concept. Before development was fully complete, however, the game was pulled out of early access, labeled "complete", and the developer just disappeared without a trace.

I think there is something to this, though, so I'm starting work on it here.

## Why open source?
Honestly, I tend to make my projects like this closed source, but I'm still learning Laravel and Vue.js, and would love any help that people are willing to provide. Besides that, I realized I also don't have many open source projects in my portfolio that show off my recent skills. So here we are.
